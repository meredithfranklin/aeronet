abstract = {Knowledge of the particle lidar ratio (S$\gamma$) and the particle linear depolarisation ratio ($\delta$$\gamma$) for different aerosol types allows for aerosol typing and aerosol-Type separation in lidar measurements. Reference values generally originate from dedicated lidar observations but might also be obtained from the inversion of AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sun/sky radiometer measurements. This study investigates the consistency of spectral S$\gamma$ and $\delta$$\gamma$ provided in the recently released AERONET version 3 inversion product for observations of undiluted mineral dust in the vicinity of the following major deserts: Gobi, Sahara, Arabian, Great Basin, and Great Victoria. Pure dust conditions are identified by an Angstr{\"{o}}m exponent {\textless} 0:4 and a fine-mode fraction {\textless} 0:1. The values of spectral S$\gamma$ are found to vary for the different source regions but generally show an increase with decreasing wavelength. The feature correlates to AERONET, retrieving an increase in the imaginary part of the refractive index with decreasing wavelength. The smallest values of S$\gamma$ D 35- 45 sr are found for mineral dust from the Great Basin desert, while the highest values of 50-70 sr have been inferred from AERONET observations of Saharan dust. Values of S$\gamma$ at 675, 870, and 1020 nm seem to be in reasonable agreement with available lidar observations, while those at 440 nm are up to 10 sr higher than the lidar reference. The spectrum of $\delta$$\gamma$ shows a maximum of 0.26-0.31 at 1020 nm and decreasing values as wavelength decreases. AERONET-derived $\delta$$\gamma$ values at 870 and 1020 nm are in line with the lidar reference, while values of 0.19-0.24 at 440 nm are smaller than the independent lidar observations by a difference of 0.03 to 0.08. This general behaviour is consistent with earlier studies based on AERONET version 2 products.},

@article{Holben1998,
abstract = {The concept and description of a remote sensing aerosol monitoring network initiated by NASA, developed to support NASA, CNES, and NASDA's Earth satellite systems under the name AERONET and expanded by national and international collaboration, is described. Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS' Data Collection. Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75{\%} of the Earth's surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90{\%} in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The system's automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals. This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system, the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description of the processing system, and access to the database.},

@article{Shin2019,
abstract = {Absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) as obtained from sun-sky photometer measurements provides a measure of the light-absorbing properties of the columnar aerosol loading. However, it is not an unambiguous aerosol-type-specific parameter, particularly if several types of absorbing aerosols, for instance black carbon (BC) and mineral dust, are present in a mixed aerosol plume. The contribution of mineral dust to total aerosol light absorption is particularly important at UV wavelengths. In this study we refine a lidar-based technique applied to the separation of dust and non-dust aerosol types for the use with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) direct sun and inversion products. We extend the methodology to retrieve AAOD related to non-dust aerosol (AAOD{\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}nd{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and BC (AAOD{\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/span{\textgreater}). We test the method at selected AERONET sites that are frequently affected by aerosol plumes that contain a mixture of Saharan or Asian mineral dust and biomass-burning smoke or anthropogenic pollution, respectively. We find that aerosol optical depth (AOD) related to mineral dust as obtained with our methodology is frequently smaller than coarse-mode AOD. This suggests that the latter is not an ideal proxy for estimating the contribution of mineral dust to mixed dust plumes. We present the results of the AAOD{\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/span{\textgreater} retrieval for the selected AERONET sites and compare them to coincident values provided in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring System aerosol reanalysis. We find that modelled and AERONET AAOD{\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/span{\textgreater} are most consistent for Asian sites or at Saharan sites with strong local anthropogenic sources.},
