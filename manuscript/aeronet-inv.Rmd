\introduction

A large body of literature has shown that satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), typically retrieved at 550 nm wavelength, reliably correlates with mass-volume concentrations of fine mode particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 um (PM$_{2.5}$). Studies that have used satellite observations to generate PM2.5 have been instrumental for air pollution - health effects research. 
The associations between AOD and different chemical components of PM2.5 are lesser known. A handful of studies using the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), an instrument onboard the NASA Terra satellite that provides observations of optical properties by particle type (size, shape, absorption), have provided evidence that different optical properties relate to different physical and chemical properties of particulate matter. Results have been somewhat inconsistent, showing differences depending on geographic area of analysis, optical components used, and statistical tools applied.
The purpose of this analysis is to make a detailed examination of the statistical relationships between ground-level PM2.5 and PM2.5 chemical components (nitrate, sulfate, elemental carbon, organic carbon, dust) and optical measures of aerosols (e.g. aerosol optical depth, angstrom exponent).

# Methods

The study encompasses the San Joaquin Valley region of central California (Figure 1). We leverage datasets available at four sites - Bakersfield, Fresno, Modesto, and Visalia. At these sites there are co-located instruments from EPA’s chemical speciation network (CSN), EPA’s air quality system (AQS) and NASA’s AERONET network. 

## Data

The CSN monitors are on a 1 in 3 or 1 in 6 day sampling schedule, providing PM2.5 mass and component PM2.5 concentrations of metals (e.g. Aluminium Al, Silicon Si, Calcium Ca, Titanium Ti, Iron Fe) obtained from X-ray fluorescence (XRF), ions (nitrate NO$_{3}^-$ and sulfate SO$_4^{2-}$) from ion chromatography, and carbons (organic OC and elemental EC) from thermal/optical analysis. To quantify dust we use the following equation: 
dust  =  2.2Al +  2.49Si +  1.63Ca +  1.94Ti +  2.42Fe

The AQS monitors provide daily concentrations of PM2.5 mass by the EPA’s Federal Reference Method, which is the highest quality gravimetric measurement method used for regulatory purposes.

AERONET sites are sunphotometers providing a “ground-up” measurement of aerosol optical properties at multiple wavelengths and have been used extensively to validate “top-down” satellite observations of related properties. Wavelength-specific AOD and angstrom exponents are the primary sunphotometer variables. Using quadratic log-log interpolation we calculated AOD 550 nm from AOD 440, 500, 675, 870 nm in log-log space. AOD at 550 nm is the most common wavelength retrieved from satellite instruments. 
A retrieval-based AERONET product, called the inversion product, provides an additional suite of aerosol properties that help distinguish size (fine, coarse effective radius), shape (asymmetry), and absorption. We excluded sunphotometer and inversion variables that had a significant proportion of missing data (~90% missing). A list of the variables included in the analysis are shown in the Appendix.
In a separate test we examine data from the SPARTAN site in Rehovot, Israel. The SPARTAN network provides data for PM2.5 mass and speciation concentrations on an integrated 1 in 9 day sampling schedule, and is colocated with an AERONET site (We don’t have the speciation data for this site so we could only look at PM2.5 for now).



## Statistical methods
Prior to model building we examined a cluster-based correlation heat map (Figure 2), which provides the Pearson correlations between all pairs of AERONET variables grouped by a decision tree. To avoid collinearity in the regression models, we kept the most relevant of a group of variables that had a correlation coefficient > |0.9|.  We then examined and picked a subset of variables connected at the mid-tier level of the tree to construct interactions. 
We fit simple linear regression models separately for PM2.5 mass, sulfate, nitrate, EC, OC, and dust with AOD 550 nm as the sole predictor variable. Multiple linear regression models were again fit separately for PM2.5 mass, sulfate, nitrate, EC, OC, and dust, but with the combined AERONET sunphotometer and inversion product as predictor variables and model selection was conducted using the “all possible subset method”. This method constructs models based on all combinations from 1 to k variable models.  We select the best model from the combinations based on highest R2, lowest RMSE, and Mallow’s Cp statistic that is close to k+1. 
Model selection for the Fresno and Bakersfield sites were examined separately and in combination in a “total CA” analysis, which combined data from Fresno, Bakersfield, Modesto, Visalia, and a special DRAGON campaign in late 2012-early 2013 over the region (8 co-located sites with PM2.5 mass).

All models were cross validated (CV) with 10-fold CV, and we report the CV R2 and RMSE. Models were fit in R using the leaps() library.



# Results

See the [R Markdown docs for bibliographies and citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

Copernicus supports biblatex and a sample bibliography is in file `sample.bib`.
Read [@Feynman1963118], and [see @Dirac1953888].

# Content section with R code chunks

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sum <- 1 + 41
```

You should always use `echo = FALSE` on R Markdown code blocks as they add formatting and styling not desired by Copernicus.
The hidden workflow results in `r sum`.

You can add verbatim code snippets without extra styles by using ` ``` ` without additional instructions.

```
sum <- 1 + 41
```

# Content section with list

If you want to insert a list, you must

- leave

- empty lines

- between each list item

because the `\tightlist` format used by R Markdown is not supported in the Copernicus template. Example:

```
- leave

- empty lines

- between each list item
```

# Examples from the official template

## FIGURES

When figures and tables are placed at the end of the MS (article in one-column style), please add \clearpage between bibliography and first table and/or figure as well as between each table and/or figure.

### ONE-COLUMN FIGURES

Include a 12cm width figure of Nikolaus Copernicus from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg) with caption using R Markdown.

```{r, out.width = "8.3cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "one column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

### TWO-COLUMN FIGURES

You can also include a larger figure.

```{r, out.width = "12cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "two column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")

## EQUATIONS

### Single-row equation

Unnumbered equations (i.e. using `$$` and getting inline preview in RStudio) are not supported by Copernicus.

\begin{equation}
1 \times 1 \cdot 1 = 42
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A = \pi r^2

## MATRICES

$$
\begin{matrix}
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
\end{matrix}
$$

## ALGORITHM

If you want to use algorithms, you can either enable the required packages in the header (the default, see `algorithms: true`), or make sure yourself that the \LaTeX packages `algorithms` and `algorithmicx` are installed so that `algorithm.sty` respectively `algorithmic.sty` can be loaded by the Copernicus template.
Copernicus staff will remove all undesirable packages from your LaTeX source code, so please stick to using the header option, which only adds the two acceptable packages.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm Caption}
\label{a1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $i\gets 10$
\IF {$i\geq 5$} 
        \STATE $i\gets i-1$
\ELSE
        \IF {$i\leq 3$}
                \STATE $i\gets i+2$
        \ENDIF
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

## CHEMICAL FORMULAS AND REACTIONS

For formulas embedded in the text, please use `\chem{}`, e.g. \chem{A \rightarrow B}.

The reaction environment creates labels including the letter R, i.e. (R1), (R2), etc.

- `\rightarrow` should be used for normal (one-way) chemical reactions

- `\rightleftharpoons` should be used for equilibria

- `\leftrightarrow` should be used for resonance structures

\begin{reaction}
A \rightarrow B \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Coper \rightleftharpoons nicus \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Publi \leftrightarrow cations
\end{reaction}

## PHYSICAL UNITS

Please use `\unit{}` (allows to save the math/`$` environment) and apply the exponential notation, for example \( 3.14\,\unit{km\,h^{-1}} \) (using LaTeX mode: `\( 3.14\,\unit{...} \)`) or \unit{0.872\,m\,s^{-1}} (using only `\unit{0.872\,m\,s^{-1}}`).

\conclusions

The conclusion goes here.
You can modify the section name with  `\conclusions[modified heading if necessary]`.
